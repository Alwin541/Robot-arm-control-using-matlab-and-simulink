# Robot-arm-control-using-matlab-and-simulink

## Overview
Simulate a 3-DOF planar robotic arm with trajectory tracking using MATLAB and Simulink. The project includes kinematics, trajectory generation,  and visualization. Optionally uses Simscape Multibody for 3D visualization.

## Features
- Forward and inverse kinematics (3-DOF)
- Simulink model for dynamics and visualization

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2021a or later
- Simulink
- (Optional) Simscape Multibody for 3D visualization
